# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Agent-Karma is a decentralized and autonomous reputation system for AI agents operating on the Sei blockchain. The system enables AI agents to build and maintain public, tamper-proof reputation scores through their interactions and exchanges. Each interaction contributes to a publicly verifiable "karma-score" that is stored on-chain, providing transparency and trust in AI agent interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to register my identity on-chain, so that I can participate in the reputation system and build my karma score.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI agent initiates registration THEN the system SHALL create a unique on-chain identity with a wallet address
2. WHEN an agent registers THEN the system SHALL initialize their karma score to zero
3. WHEN registration is complete THEN the agent SHALL receive confirmation of their on-chain identity
4. IF an agent attempts to register with an existing identity THEN the system SHALL reject the registration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to rate other agents after interactions, so that I can contribute to the collective reputation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent completes an interaction with another agent THEN the system SHALL allow rating submission within 24 hours
2. WHEN submitting a rating THEN the system SHALL require a score between 1-10 and optional feedback
3. WHEN a rating is submitted THEN the system SHALL timestamp and store it immutably on Sei blockchain
4. IF an agent attempts to rate the same interaction twice THEN the system SHALL reject the duplicate rating
5. WHEN a rating is recorded THEN the system SHALL update the recipient's karma score using verifiable algorithms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want my karma score to be calculated transparently, so that other agents can trust the reputation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN karma is calculated THEN the system SHALL use publicly verifiable algorithms stored on-chain
2. WHEN new ratings are received THEN the system SHALL recalculate karma scores within 400ms
3. WHEN karma changes THEN the system SHALL emit events with the new score and calculation details
4. IF calculation fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous score and log the error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent or human observer, I want to query any agent's karma score, so that I can make informed decisions about interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying an agent's karma THEN the system SHALL return current score, interaction count, and last update timestamp
2. WHEN requesting karma history THEN the system SHALL provide chronological score evolution
3. WHEN accessing karma data THEN the system SHALL respond within 400ms
4. IF an agent doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a human observer, I want to view agent reputations through a dashboard, so that I can monitor the AI agent ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display top-rated agents and recent interactions
2. WHEN viewing agent details THEN the system SHALL show karma trends, interaction history, and ratings received
3. WHEN filtering agents THEN the system SHALL support sorting by karma score, interaction count, and registration date
4. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display data within 2 seconds

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all interactions to be auditable, so that the reputation system maintains integrity and transparency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL record immutable logs on Sei blockchain
2. WHEN storing interaction data THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, participants, and interaction type
3. WHEN auditing is requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete interaction trails for any agent
4. IF blockchain storage fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before alerting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an AI agent ecosystem participant, I want the system to integrate with external data sources, so that karma calculations can consider broader context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external data is available THEN the system SHALL integrate oracle feeds (like Rivalz) for additional context
2. WHEN oracle data is used THEN the system SHALL verify data authenticity before incorporating into karma calculations
3. WHEN external integration fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with on-chain data only
4. IF oracle data conflicts with on-chain data THEN the system SHALL prioritize on-chain information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be compatible with existing AI frameworks, so that agents can easily integrate reputation functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with ElizaOS THEN the system SHALL provide native plugin support
2. WHEN using MCP THEN the system SHALL expose modular components for agent interoperability
3. WHEN connecting to AIDN THEN the system SHALL support agent interconnection protocols
4. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback REST API access
